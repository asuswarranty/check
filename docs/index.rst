Asus Warranty Check ‒ asuswarrantycheck.com
==================

`Asus Warranty Check <https://asuswarrantycheck.com/>`_ - Today we need to give you a point by point correlation of two incredible gaming notebooks. The two models were discharged toward the finish of a year ago and were one of the first to join the most recent NVIDIA Pascal age of designs cards. Talking about which the two models are furnished with the amazing NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070. 

'On one side of the ring, we have the exquisite ASUS ROG Strix GL502VS and on the opposite side – the powerful Acer Predator 15 (G9-593). As far as specs, the two notebooks are almost indistinguishable so it will be a savage battle yet at last, one of them will take the crown or who knows – possibly where one misses the mark the other will redress and the other way around. Stick around and discover. 

'ASUS ROG Strix GL502VS offers a structure commendable for a top notch gaming notebook. The general form feels strong and stable. The top grabs the attention with its LED-lit up ROG logo and two stripes in the center that are as opposed to the dark brushed aluminum. The top itself is effectively bendable yet no swells happen on the LCD board so that is not an issue. The pivots are solid yet you can open the PC utilizing one hand in any case. We are not especially content with the way that the base piece is produced using plastic however we surmise that ASUS needed to compromise some place (it's preferable in the development over in execution). 

'Acer Predator 15 (G9-593) is somewhat of an alternate story. While GL502VS have a greater amount of an exquisite plan the Predator 15 is looking forceful (legitimate for the name) with its immense principle exhaust vents on the back side. This model is likewise worked to last as the cover comprises out of 40% fiberglass – a solid yet lightweight material used in lift spools which hold their steel wire ropes. Be that as it may, in spite of the fiberglass the gadget loads 3742 g (8.25 lbs) which is very substantial for a 15-incher. 

'Proceeding onward to the inside, the Strix GL502VS frustrates a tad because again it uses plastic rather than aluminum as in the base piece. Plastic materials lessen the spread of warmth along the console plate which may prompt higher surface temperatures in specific zones. The console is nothing uncommon however in any event there is a decent LED backdrop illumination and the WASD keys are featured in brilliant orange that illuminates in obscurity. We are feeling the loss of the media control catches and the touchpad isn't the best either.
